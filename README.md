# COURSE PROJECT
## Project Overview

The course project this semester is PriCoSha, a system for privately sharing content items
among groups of people. PriCoSha gives users somewhat more privacy than many content
sharing sites by giving them more detailed control over who can see which content items they
post and more control over whether other people can tag content items with a user’s personal
information. You may choose the kind of content your version of PriCoSha focuses on, e.g.
photos, video clips, announcements about social or professional events, etc. The focus of the
project will be on storing data about the content, allowing users to specify who can see and/or
modify what, and providing ways for users to find content of interest. In Part 1, you’ll assume
that the content is photos, but in the remaining parts, you are encouraged to have other kinds of
content, along with customized operations for users to work with that content.

Users will be able to log in, post content items, view (some of) the content items posted by
others (public content and content posted by people who have given them access via a 'friend'
mechanism, detailed below; tag content items with usernames of people referred to in the
content items (if they have permission to do so), etc. In part 1 of the project, you will design an
ER diagram for the database. In part 2, you will convert my E-R diagram (which I will post later)
to a relational schema, write table definitions in SQL, and write some queries. Part 3 is a
milestone to guarantee that you’re making progress: you will hand in some of your source code
along with evidence that it is working. Part 4 will be the most work: using my schema from part
2, you will revise your queries, if necessary, and write the rest of the application code for the
system. A detailed specification will be provided shortly after part 2 is due.
